I used a public dataset "Iowa Liquor Retail Sales" from Big Query to explore the liquor retail chain in the state and find out how consumption and sales changed during 2012-2023 years.
The report includes:
1. A statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
