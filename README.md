I used a public dataset "Iowa Liquor Retail Sales" from Big Query to explore the liquor retail chain in the state and find out how consumption and sales changed during 2012-2023 years.
The report includes:
1. A statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KLRyR67ogYaW0QpbZ2CWnraYlVrl49d7aEevBZAmpoU/edit?usp=sharing)
4. A summary of analysis (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO7xrqUcLq4kZzlNgGLTZFgwPGt_uRe1opz1NiYKMBw/edit?usp=sharing)
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
